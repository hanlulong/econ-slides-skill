# Talk structures: arcs, budgets, and cuts

How to plan a deck for each genre. Slide counts are for *content* slides;
title, section dividers, and appendix are counted separately, although each
still consumes some presentation time.

## Slide budget

First distinguish the **total session** from **planned speech**. Unless the
organizer states otherwise, reserve 20--25% of the total session for questions
and plan 75--80% for prepared speech. Plan roughly 1.5--2 minutes per content
slide, slower for a load-bearing exhibit or proposition. Verify by rehearsal
logic, not arithmetic: a key table may take 3 minutes to land; a section
divider takes 10 seconds. Never plan one slide per minute (Cochrane,
Piazzesi) -- the audience needs time to digest the slide.

| Total session | Planned speech | Questions | Content slides | Appendix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 min | 11.25--12 min | 3--3.75 min | 6--8 | 5--12 |
| 20 min | 15--16 min | 4--5 min | 8--10 | 8--15 |
| 30 min | 22.5--24 min | 6--7.5 min | 10--14 | 10--20 |
| 45 min | 33.75--36 min | 9--11.25 min | 15--20 | 12--25 |
| 60 min | 45--48 min | 12--15 min | 20--26 | 15--30 |
| 75 min | 56.25--60 min | 15--18.75 min | 24--32 | 20--35 |
| 90 min | 67.5--72 min | 18--22.5 min | 28--38 | 20--40 |

These are starting ranges, not fill quotas. Theory talks often hold a hard
proposition or example longer; empirical talks may move faster through a
familiar design. The final budget comes from a spoken rehearsal, and the
question reserve is never recovered by padding slides or accelerating speech.

The appendix is the length-and-detail dial (Bellemare's "Magic Appendix
Trick"): a lean main line plus linked backups lets the same deck absorb
interruptions, questions, and venue changes.

## Choose the author story before the slide list

For a paper talk, the default stance is the authors' presentation of their
work, not a referee report or a discussant intervention. Write down four
things before outlining:

1. the **one primary takeaway** the audience should retain;
2. up to **two supporting claims** that explain or discipline it;
3. the paper's strongest credibility argument; and
4. the **one boundary audit**: the qualification that would most change the
   headline, whether or not it needs to appear in the main deck.

Every main-deck frame must motivate, establish, explain, support, or conclude
that story. The boundary keeps the language honest, but appears only when
omitting it would materially misstate a claim. If shown, it belongs once beside
the evidence it qualifies, not by default on ``This paper'' or the conclusion.
It never becomes a third contribution, a subtitle on the title page, or a
warning repeated throughout the deck. If the source audit invalidates the headline rather than merely
bounding it, stop before drafting and ask whether the user wants an author talk
with a weaker headline or a critical presentation.

## Audience obligations and an adaptable author-talk path

The audience must learn the question, answer, reason to believe or interpret
the answer, economic mechanism or intuition, any necessary boundary, and implication. Those
are obligations, not mandatory frame names or a universal order. Build the
shortest dependency path that lets this audience understand the paper. The
numbered path below is a useful default for many new author talks, not a
template: merge, split, reorder, or omit roles when the paper, request, or an
existing deck makes another sequence clearer. Never reorder an inherited deck
merely to match this list.

1. **Title** — `[plain]`, de-counted, the paper's exact title, authors,
   author-specific affiliations, venue/date, and a small disclaimer if needed.
   Put each institution directly beneath its author; use one shared affiliation
   only when it applies to every author. Recover central-bank or public-
   institution disclaimer wording from the paper or a prior deck. A paper title may
   break across two balanced lines. Do not replace it with a finding or add an
   editorial subtitle about what the evidence can or cannot identify.
2. **Key question, with motivation, 1–2 slides total** — call the object
   **Key question**, not "The economic question." When the concise question is
   the frame's main idea, put it directly in the title; use the structural label
   only when motivation or setup shares the frame, and never relegate the
   question to a subtitle. Open with one striking fact, anecdote, or policy
   tension, then state the research question in one plain
   sentence as a policy counterfactual, parameter, or test of theory. Use an
   existing source figure when it is the paper's natural hook; otherwise use a
   clean single-column sequence of claims and evidence. Not "the literature has
   long...". Antecedents appear as 2–4 gray inline citations (`\graycite`),
   never as a review slide. A second opener that restates the first is not a
   second idea: merge it. In a short talk, this often lets the answer arrive
   within the first few content frames without skipping a prerequisite.
3. **This paper (the punchline slide)** — author-story anatomy:
   - a framing line ("We <verb> <object> in <setting>: …") with empirical
     scope (setting, units, N, period) or theoretical scope (environment,
     model class, equilibrium object);
   - the primary takeaway and up to two supporting claims, each with a
     **bold lead phrase** and a warranted magnitude in words when useful;
     add a short sub-reading only when it advances the economic logic;
   - no routine boundary block: if accuracy requires immediate qualification,
     attach one subordinate phrase to the claim it qualifies; otherwise keep
     the boundary beside the later evidence or in Q\&A;
     no standard errors or stars on an empirical punchline, and no proof
     machinery or condition dump on a theory punchline;
   - a bold **Implication:** capstone line.
   Assume the audience is about to leave: after this slide they can state
   what you found *and why it works*. Each selected claim is supported by
   its own slide later in the deck.
   In theory talks, choose the formal payoffs the paper actually earns: a
   theorem, tractability or reduction, a mechanism or decomposition, a
   representation result, comparative statics, welfare or policy, and an
   application are possible roles, not a required list. Order the selected
   payoffs as one argument and do not force them into a fixed number of
   contributions.
4. **Roadmap, when useful** — after the intro, name the next three or four
   stops in plain language. Empirical examples are setting and data, design,
   main result, and interpretation; theory examples are environment,
   mechanism, main proposition, and application. This is a 10--20 second
   audience contract, not
   a section divider, miniature literature review, or list of every slide.
   Use regular-weight entries. On a repeated long-talk roadmap, gray inactive
   modules instead of bolding the current one.
5. **Paper-specific setup** — choose the branch; never force one branch's
   vocabulary onto another.
   - **Empirical:** Setting/Data states sources and linkage, unit, N, period,
     consequential restriction, outcome construction, treatment or exposure,
     nonstandard measures, assignment level, and inference level. Data may
     share a slide with the experiment or design only when all objects remain
     clear and legible.
   - **Theory:** Environment states agents, timing, information, choices and
     constraints, equilibrium or solution concept, and the load-bearing
     assumption in words before notation. A pure theory paper has no Data
     slide unless data, calibration, or estimation is part of the paper.
   - **Structural/quantitative:** introduce data or calibration targets and
     the model environment before identification, fit, or counterfactuals.
6. **Design / mechanism** — empirical papers state the variation, comparison,
   key identifying condition, assignment and inference levels, and decisive
   diagnostic. For theory papers, first diagnose whether the mechanism is
   singular, complementary, or competing. State a singular force directly;
   show complementary links as one intelligible sequence when possible; give
   competing forces parallel treatments and synthesize the net effect before
   the result that depends on it. Define notation at first use. Structural
   papers explain what variation identifies which parameter. Prefer source exhibits, native
   equations, or concise text; create a timeline, DAG, or schematic only when
   the relationship is materially harder to understand without one. If an
   empirical diagnostic invalidates the identifying condition, the result
   stays descriptive and that fact appears once in the main line.
7. **Main result** — match the treatment to the paper.
   - **Empirical:** one load-bearing exhibit, selected through the source-first
     hierarchy, plus a bottom reading that translates economic magnitude.
   - **Theory:** state the proposition in words first; show only the formal
     statement needed for precision; keep load-bearing conditions on the same
     frame; end with one intuition line. Put the proof in the appendix unless
     the proof idea is itself the contribution. Never manufacture a figure or
     force a table for a theorem.
   - **Structural/quantitative:** show model fit before the counterfactual; the
     counterfactual receives the main-result hierarchy and economic scale.
8. **Supporting results / mechanism** — one idea per frame; robustness is
   a single bullet or one compressed slide pointing to appendix buttons.
9. **Conclusion** — a compressed echo, not a duplicate of "This paper." Keep
   only the answer to the Key question, one useful supporting result, and the
   **Implication:** line. Recall a boundary only when ending without it would
   materially misstate the result.
   Remove sample dates, specification ranges, standard errors, robustness
   inventory, and new detail. The conclusion carries no `\PlaceNav`,
   `\hyperlink`, Beamer button, or appendix link. End on the takeaway; no
   "Thank you / Questions?" slide (thank them with your voice).
10. **Appendix** — in a new bundled-theme deck, `\AppendixStart` then backups
    with `\BackButton`s; in an existing deck, preserve its appendix system. Use
    full
    tables and robustness for empirical work; proofs, alternative assumptions,
    and extensions for theory; fit and calibration diagnostics for structural
    work; a fuller literature slide and anticipated-question slides for any
    branch.

Preview-of-results dispute, resolved: preview the *bottom line* as one crisp
sentence on the "This paper" slide (Shapiro, Startz, Evans), but do not
pre-run the results tables (Cochrane's objection is to the long preview).

## Per-role frame anatomy (different sections have different structures)

These are useful shapes, not fill quotas. Choose the smallest structure that
communicates the role cleanly, and draft it in one column unless simultaneous
comparison is the point.

- **Key question / opener** — an existing source chart under a claim title, a
  concise question used directly as the frame title, or a single-column
  sequence of two claim--evidence blocks closing on the Key question. Do not
  create an annotated chart merely because the opener lacks one.
- **Punchline ("This paper")** — the anatomy in the arc above: framing line,
  one primary takeaway, up to two supports, and the Implication capstone.
- **Data** — run-in labeled facts naming sources/linkage, unit, period, sample
  and consequential restriction, outcome, treatment/exposure, and nonstandard
  heterogeneity measures. Add a short statement of who the sample represents.
  An existing data exhibit or a native compact table may replace prose when it
  communicates all of those fields more clearly.
- **Design** — the comparison, counterfactual condition, assignment and
  inference levels, and the diagnostic the audience should watch. Data and
  design may be combined only when neither layer becomes shorthand.
- **Result** — claim title; `\framesubtitle` = the exact experiment; one
  exhibit. A load-bearing static exhibit normally gets one normal-body-size
  `\Takeaway` beneath it, after a bounded visual gap, stating insight, economic scale, intuition,
  interpretation, or the decisive limitation rather than repeating a cell; a
  semantic build may use 1–3 color-keyed reading lines revealed with the
  evidence, the last one the synthesis. Never use both. For a load-bearing theorem, a compact result box
  may carry the assumptions and numbered result; do not use the same box
  treatment for ordinary claims or caveats.
- **Mechanism** — an annotated source equation, a necessary schematic, or a
  concise verbal chain; define new symbols economically and add an
  **Intuition:** reading only to the depth the argument requires. Diagnose
  singular, complementary, or competing forces before choosing the frame
  count. When competing forces each need a frame, give them the same skeleton
  (object, current decision, equilibrium effect, sign) and follow with one
  synthesis that shows what determines the net result.
- **Conclusion** — the compressed landing: answer, one support, then the
  Implication capstone. Recall a boundary only when accuracy requires it. No navigation links and no
  sample or robustness bookkeeping.
- **Roadmap** — when useful, three or four meaningful section-level stops after
  the introduction. Use regular weight; in repeated seminar roadmaps, gray
  inactive modules. Do not add generic explanatory sublines merely to fill the
  page. Use bounded list spacing or a vertically centered compact group; never
  distribute ordinary items with repeated `\vfill`.
- **Dividers** — intentionally sparse and reserved for genuine section breaks.

Further idioms (verified across conference, structural, and seminar decks):
a "This paper" block in long talks may be 2–3 stacked framing-line blocks
rather than one enumerate (the enumerate is the compressed conference
form); a data slide may use a two-column source/calibration table only when
the row-wise comparison is irreducible; a mechanism slide may pair a necessary
diagram with a worked numeric example whose computations match the diagram's
arrow colors; on
result figures the numbers normally live on the exhibit, while the reading
line uses one primary emphasis treatment for the economic message. Emphasize
direction, scale, comparison, or a decisive magnitude according to the paper
and the inherited style; do not mechanically bold every number or ban a
number when it is the insight. A `\framesubtitle` may be a causal
arrow-chain ("frictions → choices → prices"); the conclusion is always shorter
than ``This paper'' and contains only the answer, one support, any necessary
boundary, and the implication.

Splitting rules: one exhibit per slide; competing mechanisms that cannot be
understood together get one parallel frame each with identical skeletons and
a synthesis frame before any result that depends on their net sign; do not
split a singular force or a legible complementary chain merely for symmetry.
A figure that gains series is ONE frame with
overlay builds (one reading bullet per build), not several frames; chain
consecutive slides assertion → evidence → interpretation; every punchline
claim is supported by its own later slide; formula and its evidence split
into two slides only when both are load-bearing; machinery to the appendix
(main deck carries the interpreted version, appendix the raw one).

Whenever a new figure is proposed, record in `structure-plan.md` why no source
figure, crop, native table, equation, or text can do the job. After generating
it, inspect that figure individually and again inside every rendered slide
that uses it; the figure is not accepted on the strength of a deck-level
contact sheet alone.

## Genre adjustments

### Conference session (15--45 min total)

- There is no hidden 20-minute default. A 15-minute total session carries
  11.25--12 minutes of speech; a 30-minute session carries 22.5--24. Merge or
  expand whole argumentative units to fit the prepared-speech budget. Keep a
  quick Roadmap only when it materially helps the audience track distinct
  modules.
- In an empirical short talk, Data and design may share one complete frame only
  when every required data object survives. In a pure theory short talk,
  Environment and Mechanism may share one frame only when every primitive and
  the load-bearing assumption remains clear.
- For an empirical or structural paper with a separate model, choose which of
  model detail or auxiliary results receives depth; summarize the other. A
  pure theory paper's proposition is its result and cannot be cut as optional
  "theory."
- Cut in this order when over budget: literature, data minutiae or secondary
  assumptions, summary statistics or proof steps, robustness or extensions,
  then maps/photos. Never cut the punchline, required setup, or main result.
- Prefer the paper's existing legible result figure when it carries the
  finding. Otherwise use the smallest faithful native table or text treatment;
  do not create a chart merely to replace a serviceable table.
- Assume zero protected time. As a planning test, ask whether the punchline can
  land by about minute 3 in a short session or minute 5 in a 30--45 minute
  session without omitting information needed to understand it.

### Department seminar (60–90 min)

- The Sargent rule: reach the setup/model inside 10 minutes (Piazzesi).
- Expect combat: know which slides you will skip if behind and which
  appendix slides to deploy if ahead. Mark them while drafting.
- Orient at every transition ("model's on the table; now identification").
  Seminars may repeat roadmap slides with completed sections grayed; a short
  talk uses at most one quick Roadmap after the intro, and only when useful.
- Design the opening to exploit the 10–15-minute protected window where it
  exists: question, contribution, preview land before hands go up.

### Job market talk (75–90 min)

- The talk's job is the job: engineer the **two-sentence takeaway** —
  (a) the exciting thing they learned, (b) the clever thing you did
  (Startz) — and land both in the first five minutes.
- Pitch to smart generalists ("JEP, not Econometrica"): most of the room
  has not read past your abstract.
- Three-act structure: accessible opening → one controlled technical dive
  that proves mastery → resurface to implications everyone follows.
- If a boundary is needed to prevent overreading, state it credibly and
  briefly; keep secondary vulnerabilities in a richer appendix than any other
  genre (the five people who read the paper will ask).

### Theory and structural talks (corpus is thin here; skill defaults)

- Replace the Data slide with **Environment** (agents, timing, information,
  in plain English before any math) and identification with **Mechanism**.
  Diagnose whether the result comes from one force, reinforcing links, or
  competing forces. Competing forces get parallel explanations and a net-
  effect synthesis; a singular or compact complementary mechanism should not
  be inflated into several slides. Use an existing source
  picture, an annotated equation, or concise text; create a schematic only
  when the relation is materially harder to understand without one.
- Propositions: statement in words → formal statement → intuition; proof
  sketch only if it *is* the contribution; full proof to appendix.
- Structural: model fit gets one exhibit ("Data | Model" table); the
  counterfactual is the punchline and gets the main-result treatment.
- A worked toy example may be built progressively across overlays when it is
  necessary to make a hard theoretical mechanism concrete. In long formats,
  budget 2–3 slides only when that example is genuinely load-bearing.

### Mixed papers

- Draw the paper's dependency map before naming slides: which component
  establishes the mechanism, which disciplines or identifies it, and which
  quantifies, tests, or applies it.
- Order by that dependency rather than alternating model and evidence because
  the manuscript does. Each switch must answer a live audience question or
  supply an object the next result requires.
- Choose one headline contribution for the talk. A model result and an
  empirical result may both be load-bearing, but they should form one argument
  rather than two compressed talks competing for emphasis.
- In a short talk, compress the component that supplies validation or scope;
  never cut the primitive, data object, identifying comparison, or model
  condition needed to interpret the headline.

## Retargeting a deck to a new venue

Never fork by commenting out frames (unmaintainable — the graveyard master
anti-pattern). Procedure:

1. Treat the richest existing deck as source of truth.
2. Rebuild the target as a **fresh file** that `\input`s shared frame
   modules or copies frames forward; drop whole frames per the cut order
   above rather than thinning every frame.
3. Anything cut from the main line moves to the appendix before it is
   deleted outright — questions follow the paper, not the venue.
4. Update `\date`, venue line, and the slide budget; recompile and re-run
   the checks; visually re-inspect (cuts orphan `\hyperlink` targets —
   `check_deck` and the compile log catch dead references).
5. Same paper, shorter clock ⇒ re-choose emphasis (Shapiro's scaling rule):
   a 15-minute cut is a different talk about the same paper, not the
   90-minute deck played fast.
